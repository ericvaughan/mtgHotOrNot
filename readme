Plan

- Basically implement a sort via 2-card comparisons of power level in a vaccuum.
- Also maybe do some slicing and dicing queries to see hit rate of removal spells and standard cube analysis

Components
- Card list ingester
- Card image downloader (cache to disk)
- GUI (Display card images + select card)
- Sorting Engine (select matchups, record state to disk and perform ordering)
